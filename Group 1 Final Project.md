## Introduction and Objectives
to create a plant that is optimized for low cost and a high performance, and looking at the regions a future wastewater plant would serve, trickling filters are a promising technology due to their low-energy requirements


A trickling filter is a secondary wastewater treatment system that removes organic matter from the wastewater through biological means, and is crucial for the removal of harmful pathogens. Looking to improve on the traditional industrial-scale trickling filter design, previous work identified an issue with the process: there is a substantial amount of unused space in the trickling treatment unit due to the uneven flow of wastewater across the system (preferential flow). The primary objective of this sub-team is to continue to develop a novel design for a highly efficient trickling filter with a minimized footprint in terms of space.
