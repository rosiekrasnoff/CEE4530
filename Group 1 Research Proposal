Intro/context – What is the problem? Why is it important?
- We're curious to see if the water will be aerated after trickling down the string. This is important because we want to know the feasibility of the idea of a string trickling filters as a new wastewater treatment technique. If the water is not aerated on the string while it trickles down, there is no potential for treatment because the decomposition of waste requires oxygen.

Objectives – What is the hypothesis? What will you do to test the hypothesis?
- We hypothesize that the water will be aerated after trickling down the string. To test this, we will trickle a mixture of various concentrations of sodium sulfite + DI water down a hydrophilic string at various flow rates and then test the effluent to see if the water has any dissolved oxygen in it by the time it reaches the end.

Experimental plan including – How will you measure it?
- We will measure if aeration has occurred by using the DO probe to determine if the effluent has any dissolved oxygen in it, which would indicate that there has been enough oxygenation for the COD, which will be due to the Na2SO3.

Key design parameters
- Flow rate of water (pumping rate)
- Concentration of sodium sulfite

Timeline of tasks/experiments
- 04/12/19: Design / draw the set up.
- 04/19/19: Set up experiment and start experimentation.
- 04/26/19: Run / gather data on experiment.
- 05/03/19: Analyze collected data.
- 05/10/19: Prepare for presentation.

Possible hurdles/challenges
- Because this is a high risk project, there is a chance that the water may not aerate at any of the tested concentrations of sodium sulfite or varying flow rates.
- It won't be easy to create a string digester model that is 3 meters tall in our current lab setting.
- It'll be tricky / time-consuming to set up the microtubing in the exact position to trickle the water onto the string without any losses.

Resources needed to conduct experiments – What tools will you use?
- Hydrophilic string - we will use what the string digester subteam has been using and they say we can just take from what they have in the lab
- Sodium sulfite
- DI water
- Peristaltic pump
- Microtubing

Expectations/Anticipated results
- We expect the water that is collected after trickling down the string to be aerated. In other words, the DO probe should detect significant levels of oxygen in the effluent.
