1. Eliminate the data from each data set when the dissolved oxygen concentration was less than 2 mg/L. This will ensure that all of the sulfite has reacted. Also remove the data when the dissolved oxygen concentration was greater than 6 mg/L to reduce the effect of measurement errors when the oxygen deficit is small.
2. Plot a representative subset of the data showing dissolved oxygen vs. time. Perhaps show 5 plots on one graph.
3. Calculate C⋆ based on the average water temperature, barometric pressure, and the equation from environmental processes analysis called O2_sat. C⋆=PO2e(1727T−2.105) where T is in Kelvin, PO2 is the partial pressure of oxygen in atmospheres, and C⋆ is in mg/L.
4. Estimate k^v,l using linear regression and equation (103) for each data set.

$$Equation \; 103:$$
$$\ln \frac{C^{*} -C}{C^{*} -C_{0} } =-\hat{k}_{v,l} (t-t_{0} )$$

5. Create a graph with a representative plot showing the model curve (as a smooth curve) and the data from one experiment. You will need to derive the equation for the concentration of oxygen as a function of time based on equation (103).
6. Plot k^v,l as a function of airflow rate (μmole/s).
7. Plot OTE as a function of airflow rate (?mole/s) with the oxygen deficit (C⋆−C) set at 6 mg/L.
8. Comment on the oxygen transfer efficiency and the trend or trends that you observe.
9. Propose a change to the experimental apparatus that would increase the efficiency.
10. Verify that your report and graphs meet the requirements.
